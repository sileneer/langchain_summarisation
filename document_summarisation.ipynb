So my probabilities are split among three scenarios: 1) most likely, we experience a blow off top before the end of Q1 2022, followed by a shallower, but still painful multi-year bear market…Ironically, the most bearish case here (Q1 blow-off top) may be the most bullish long-term.”\n",

Market cap can stay the same when realized value spikes and vice versa. It’s a dynamic measure that accounts for flow.

      " In 2022, many people lost money due to poorly managed companies, but the survivors are well capitalized and shipping product.

Even crypto skeptic Matt Levine of Bloomberg sees the potential of crypto, believing that if so many smart finance people have moved into the crypto financial system, they will eventually figure out how to make it useful. The debate now is not whether crypto could be good, but how it can be used.\n",
      "\n",
      " Crypto can be a great tool for businesses to disrupt incumbents, but it can also be abused. Good token designs should create an early user base and improve the product, not just reward the founders and VCs. Tokens only work in markets with network effects, otherwise it is a multi-level marketing scheme that can be detrimental to people's time and money.\n",

      " Bitcoin has entered a \"historic buy\" range, and stablecoins now represent four of the top ten crypto assets. The Merge, a software equivalent of the Moon Landing, was successful, and other Layer-1's like Cosmos, Solana, and rollup chains have made significant breakthroughs. Fees have decreased as a result. We are two years into a DeFi bear market, which still faces technical headwinds and hacks.\n",

      " Despite regulatory challenges, core primitives such as Automated Market Makers, Flash Loans, and Protocol Controlled Value are here to stay. NFTs are data wrappers that enable secure sharing or transactions of any intellectual property, synthetic asset, consumer digital good, or identity token on-chain. DAOs with on-chain voting, delegation, and community treasury management are now possible, allowing for the formation and wind down of online communities and collectively-managed property.

      " Building in bear markets is easier than bull markets due to fewer distractions and the ability to identify real product-market fit. This crypto winter is different from previous cycles due to the availability of dry powder, and there are many opportunities to build bridges, set standards, develop primitives, onboard users, stress test infrastructure, and tell product stories.\n",

      " Bitcoin is becoming a more credible asset and is currently a more attractive investment than gold. If Bitcoin reaches parity with gold, it could yield a 25x return, which would bring the price of Bitcoin to $500,000.\n",

      " Ethereum is a virtual machine and world computer, but its economic drivers and unit economics make it more comparable to a distributed bank than a tech platform. It is already a top five financial platform and has become a disinflationary asset with its Merge to Proof-of-Stake, reducing the dilutive impact holders will experience.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author questions whether Ethereum's current value is enough to justify a 5x increase in valuation that would put it on the same level as Big Tech companies. The author acknowledges the positive post-Merge Ethereum economics, but does not believe that Ethereum will surpass Web1 giants in the near future due to the majority of its current transactions being finance and trading related. Additionally, DeFi's unit economics may be negatively impacted by a high-inflation, high-interest rate environment.\n",
      "\n",
      " Apple, Microsoft, and Google have increasing Price/Earnings (P/E) ratios, while Ethereum's P/E is 195 and its revenues are shrinking. Ethereum is being credited as a monetary asset, computing platform, and yield generator, but if any of these narratives cool, it will face headwinds. Other Layer-1's are also a factor in the Ethereum bull case.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ethereum currently holds a 70%+ market share in the \"neutral\" L1 space, with a total market cap of $155 billion. Other L1 networks have a combined market cap of $57 billion, and whether or not this is a fair share will depend on how attractive one finds the various other L1 networks' value capture mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      " The ownership of tokens for Solana, Avalanche, and Aptos is still high, and it is unclear if selling pressure will hit those networks once supply unlocks. It is also unclear if any other L1 developer ecosystems will catch up to Ethereum's unit economics as a high value settlement chain. Investors must decide whether to pick winners or buy the basket in order to compete with Ethereum's dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      " The DeFi market is currently small compared to traditional banking, with a market cap of less than $15 billion and Total Value Locked of $40 billion. However, with positive regulatory developments, improved security and lower transaction fees, DeFi could become a lucrative sector of crypto in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      " Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are currently worth around $8 billion, but have the potential to grow to trillions of dollars worth of assets. It is recommended to invest in infrastructure businesses related to NFTs rather than specific projects, as the value of art-based NFTs is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",

      "\" It is possible to predict a confidence interval for Coinbase trading volumes by looking at Uniswap and adding 40-60%. Additionally, there are only 13 decentralized applications with $10 million in run rate revenue. To improve the data available, investments are being made in the build-out of better protocol metrics, and a GAAP or IFRS standard for crypto assets is being proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2021 and the first half of 2022, there was a total of $55.9 billion invested in Centralized Infrastructure, Decentralized Infrastructure and NFTs, and CeFi startups. Regulators are working to create disclosures for the crypto economy, and when this is done, it will be easier for value investors and consumer protectors to investigate the user adoption of these investments.\n",
      "\n",
      " The DeFi sector saw a decrease in total deal flow from 2021 to the first half of 2022, but total dollar funding still eclipsed the 2021 full-year numbers. However, the second half of the year saw a 70%+ reduction in investment dollars and a slowdown in total investment pace. Companies that raised in 2021 and 2022 should have lengthy runways, but may need to make adjustments to survive beyond the next 1-2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2023, venture markets for more mature companies will become more competitive, with a reduction in deal sizes and pace. 2021's fund vintage is unlikely to look good, but it may be a good time to deploy capital professionally. Startups may be able to take advantage of M&A opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      " This report assumes that the bear market will continue, but there is potential for a V-shaped recovery depending on macroeconomic and regulatory factors. The market sentiment is that there will be a recession in 2023, but some investors think the Fed will pivot and accept multi-year high inflation. If this is the case, physical commodities like gold and oil could perform strongly, and digital gold and digital oil could follow suit. Macro forces led the 2020-2021 crypto bull market and the 2022 collapse, and could lead to a 2023 recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Electric Capital 2022 developer report may provide insight into the market recovery, however there are still potential negative market shocks. Bitcoin miners are selling to cover costs and debt, and the Mt Gox bankruptcy proceeds may be distributed in early 2023, potentially leading to DCG and Genesis selling up to $60 million of GBTC per quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ethereum's post-Merge supply dynamics are disinflationary, but the tax consequences of post-Merge staking rewards may lead to spot selling pressure in the market. Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is a mess of project-specific selling, with more than $50 billion worth of supply that could hit the market. This report will discuss buyouts versus bankruptcies.\n",
      "\n",
      " Last year, many crypto companies were optimistic about their IPOs, but in the past few months, many of them have faced bankruptcy, pulled their SPACs, taken emergency down rounds, and laid off staff. Despite this, it presents a potential entry point for larger institutions who believe in crypto's long-term role in the global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2023, it is possible that large financial institutions such as Fidelity, Blackrock, and JPMorgan may attempt to take over crypto institutions through mergers and acquisitions. This could be a result of the current downturn in the crypto market, which could be the bridge needed for institutions to integrate crypto products.\n",
      "\n",
      " Four investors discussed their biggest winners and losers, what they hold, and what they like. Messari Stock (Series B) was the biggest winner for TBI, while LUNA was the biggest loser. Ally's biggest winner was not specified, but ETH was the biggest loser. Maartje's biggest winner was adding more ETH on the cheap, while CRV was the biggest loser. Tom's biggest winner was American dollars (0%), while ETH (-70%) was the biggest loser. All four investors held a variety of tokens, such as BTC, ETH, and SNX, and had different themes they were interested in, such as TIPIN/PoPW, market capture, and institutional/nation state adoption of crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      " Dustin and Chase are two crypto investors who have different portfolios and preferences. Dustin likes social use cases, Ethereum-centric rollup ecosystems, decentralized rendering and compute, and cash. Chase likes Ethereum and Bitcoin as bases for future network states, Ethereum core devs, protocols as public goods, decentralized social combined with DeFi, TIPIN experiments, SNARKs and oracles for cross-chain communications, and the friends they have made along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      " Kunal holds RPL, LDO, ETH, MINA, and BTC and likes liquid staking protocols. Sami holds BTC, XMR, ETH, RNDR, AKT, AR, and HNT and likes physical infrastructure protocols.
