      "\" This passage discusses the changing value of a college degree over time. In the early 1970s, a High School GED was enough to guarantee employment, but by the early 1980s, a college degree was necessary. By the time the speaker graduated in 1988, a college degree was no longer a guarantee of employment. The speaker then questions the value of a college degree, concluding that it provides knowledge and expertise in a specific subject, but its worth in the job market is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      " Many college graduates are facing a competitive job market and may not have a job that directly reflects their degree. It can be scary not knowing what the future holds, but it is important to accept this reality and not be too impressed with our accomplishments.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage talks about the importance of learning from experience and applying it to one's own life. It encourages readers to not fall into the trap of feeling like a victim and to instead take ownership of their lives and make the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage discusses the use of the word \"unbelievable\" and how it should not be used to describe something that is spectacular or phenomenal. It also talks about how the word should be used to describe negative events such as the 9/11 attacks, diseases that have cures, and people lying to each other. The overall message is to give others and ourselves more credit and to believe in what we witness.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage discusses the difference between happiness and joy. Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome, while joy is a constant feeling that comes from doing what we are made to do, regardless of the outcome. Joy is not a choice, and it is not reliant on results.\n",
      "\n",
      " An actor found more success and joy in their work when they stopped trying to make it a means to an end. Joy is found in the process of doing what we are meant to do. As an example, the actor visited a Voodoo shop in South of New Orleans and found vials of magic potions in columns with headings above each potion.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage discusses the cultural values of money and success, and how they have been financialized. It questions what success means to each individual, suggesting that it could be money, a healthy family, a happy marriage, helping others, being famous, or leaving the world a better place.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage encourages the reader to ask themselves what their definition of success is and to prioritize their character and values. The speaker suggests that success is a measurement of five things: fatherhood, being a good husband, health, career, and friendships. They suggest checking in with these five things each day to measure success.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is emphasizing the importance of taking care of all aspects of life, such as career, relationships, spiritual health, friendships, and social life. He suggests that if one of these areas is neglected, it will become weak and eventually go bankrupt. To maintain success, one must take a daily tally and put in the work to attend to all areas of life.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage is about the importance of making good choices and avoiding leaving \"crumbs\" of regret, guilt, and remorse. It is suggested that we should practice delayed gratification and feed the good wolf inside us more than the bad one. This will help us avoid leaving crumbs that will cause us stress in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage encourages people to make choices today that will pay them back in the future, such as prepping the coffee maker the night before or preparing for a job interview early. It also encourages people to make choices that will fill them up and keep their fire lit, such as choosing not to hook up with a married woman. This is the beauty of delayed gratification.\n",
      "\n",
      " This poem encourages the reader to invest in their future, pay their debts on time, and have their husband carry a gun for protection. It also suggests getting a return on investment (ROI) to customize their future.\"\n",
